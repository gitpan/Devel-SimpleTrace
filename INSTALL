INSTALLATION NOTES
    
    This module can be installed using two methods. Choose whichever 
    fits your configuration or your taste. 

    The Flashy New Way
    ------------------
    You can use Module::Build, the pure Perl installation method, 
    by striking the following keys on your keyboard: 
    
      $ perl Build.PL
      $ ./Build test
      $ ./Build install


    The Good Old Way
    ----------------
    The brave ExtUtils::MakeMaker can still be used by simply typing 
    the following commands:
    
      $ perl Makefile.PL
      $ make
      $ make install
    
    and everything should work fine.
